# Remote Development Server

The remote development server for this project is:

```
Host: 192.168.200.37
User: root
SSH: root@192.168.200.37
```

## Deployment Methods

### 1. Smart Deploy (Recommended — works everywhere)
```bash
./scripts/cursor-deploy.sh deploy    # Auto-detects local vs cloud
./scripts/cursor-deploy.sh status    # Check CI/deployment status
./scripts/cursor-deploy.sh preview   # Get preview URL for current PR
```

### 2. Direct Deploy (Local network only)
- Use `.\scripts\deploy.ps1` (Windows) or `./scripts/deploy.sh` (Linux/Mac)
- The application is installed at `/opt/grocyscan` on the remote server
- Service name: `grocyscan` (managed by systemd)
- Application port: 3334

### 3. CI/CD Deploy (Automatic)
- **Preview**: Opens automatically when a PR is created (via GitHub Actions + Proxmox runner)
- **Production**: Deploys automatically when PR is merged to `main`
- See `.cursor/rules/cicd.mdc` for full CI/CD documentation

## Common Commands

```bash
# SSH into the server
ssh root@192.168.200.37

# Check service status
ssh root@192.168.200.37 "systemctl status grocyscan"

# View logs
ssh root@192.168.200.37 "journalctl -u grocyscan -f"

# Restart service
ssh root@192.168.200.37 "systemctl restart grocyscan"

# Check CI status (works in cloud agents too)
gh run list --branch $(git rev-parse --abbrev-ref HEAD)
```
