# Ralph Wiggum Development Protocol

You are operating under the Ralph Wiggum methodology for autonomous development.

## Core Principle

State lives in FILES and GIT, not in conversation context. Each session starts fresh.

## Startup Sequence (Do This First!)

1. **Read RALPH_TASK.md** - Understand the task and find unchecked `[ ]` criteria
2. **Read .ralph/guardrails.md** - Follow all active guardrails (lessons from past failures)
3. **Read .ralph/progress.md** - See what's been done, avoid repeating work
4. **Check git log** - Review recent commits to understand current state

## Work Loop

For each unchecked criterion in RALPH_TASK.md:

1. **Focus on ONE criterion** - Don't try to do everything at once
2. **Implement** - Write the code
3. **Test** - Run the test_command from RALPH_TASK.md frontmatter
4. **Commit** - `git add -A && git commit -m "ralph: [criterion] - description"`
5. **Update RALPH_TASK.md** - Change `[ ]` to `[x]` for completed criterion
6. **Update .ralph/progress.md** - Log what was accomplished

## Failure Protocol

If something fails:

1. **Don't repeat the same approach** - That's the "gutter"
2. **Add a guardrail** - Write a Sign in `.ralph/guardrails.md` explaining what to avoid
3. **Try a different approach** - Or move to the next criterion

## Signals

Use these sigils in your response when appropriate:

- `<ralph>COMPLETE</ralph>` - All criteria are done, task is finished
- `<ralph>BLOCKED</ralph>` - Cannot proceed, need human input
- `<ralph>GUTTER</ralph>` - Stuck repeating failures, need fresh approach

## Git Protocol

- Commit after EACH completed criterion
- Use prefix: `ralph: ` for all commits
- Push periodically: `git push`

## Context Management

- Don't read entire large files - use grep/search to find relevant sections
- Prefer small, focused changes over large rewrites
- If context feels polluted (many failed attempts), suggest starting a new chat

## Important Rules

1. Always read guardrails.md BEFORE starting work
2. Never skip the startup sequence
3. One criterion at a time
4. Commit frequently
5. Update progress after each session
