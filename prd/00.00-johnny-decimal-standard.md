# 00.00 Johnny Decimal Standard

This document defines the Johnny Decimal numbering system used for organizing Homebot product requirements documentation.

---

## Overview

[Johnny Decimal](https://johnnydecimal.com/) is a system for organizing information using a structured numbering scheme:

```
AC.ID - Name
│  │
│  └── Item ID (10-99 for content, 00-09 reserved)
└───── Area.Category (10-99)
```

---

## Structure

### Areas

Areas are groups of 10 numbers representing broad topics:

| Area | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `00-09` | System management, standards, indexes |
| `10-19` | Foundation - standards, vision, planning |
| `20-29` | Requirements - user stories, functional specs |
| `30-39` | Technical Design - architecture, data, API, UI |
| `40-49` | Operations - install, observability, security |
| `50-59` | Quality - testing, standards, troubleshooting |
| `60-69` | Core Features - individual feature PRDs |
| `70-79` | Household Features - people, recipes, shopping |
| `80-89` | Ralph Phases - execution task documents |
| `90-99` | Appendices - reference documentation |

### Categories

Categories are the first two digits, defining the document's classification:

```
10 = Foundations category
11 = (available for related foundation docs)
20 = Requirements category
30 = Architecture category
...etc
```

### IDs

IDs are the two digits after the decimal. Content IDs start at `.10`:

| ID Range | Purpose |
|----------|---------|
| `.00` | Index/JDex for the category |
| `.01` | Inbox - unsorted items |
| `.02` | Task/project management |
| `.03` | Templates |
| `.04` | Links/references |
| `.05-.07` | Reserved for expansion |
| `.08` | Someday/maybe |
| `.09` | Archive |
| `.10-.99` | **Content documents** |

## Rules

1. **Never reuse IDs** - Once an ID is assigned, it stays even if the document is archived
2. **Content starts at .10** - Reserve .00-.09 for system use
3. **Use kebab-case** - Lowercase with hyphens for filenames
4. **One thing per ID** - Each ID is exactly one document
5. **Areas are fixed** - Don't change area definitions without updating this document

---

## Adding New Documents

1. Identify the correct area (10-19, 20-29, etc.)
2. Find the next available ID in that area (e.g., if 60.15 exists, use 60.16)
3. Create the file with format `AC.ID-name.md`
4. Update this index document
