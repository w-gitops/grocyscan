# 10.11 Executive Summary

## 10.11.1 Vision

Homebot is a standalone home inventory management system that provides intelligent barcode scanning, product tracking, meal planning, cost analysis, and document management. It operates independently while offering optional compatibility with the classic Grocy API for users migrating from or integrating with existing Grocy installations.

**Core Differentiators:**
- **Tablet-first PWA** - Installable, offline-capable web app optimized for tablet in kitchen/warehouse; mobile and desktop compatible. See [30.13 UI Specification](30.13-ui-specification.md).
- **Multi-tenant architecture** - Support multiple households with isolated data
- **LPN (License Plate Number) tracking** - Instance-level inventory for specific items
- **Integrated document management** - Receipt OCR, purchase tracking via Paperless-ngx
- **Intelligent food analysis** - Ingredient parsing, processing concern flagging
- **Modern tech stack** - Vue.js/Quasar frontend, FastAPI backend, PostgreSQL with RLS

## 10.11.2 Problem Statement

Current home inventory solutions suffer from:

| Problem | Impact |
|---------|--------|
| Limited lookup sources | Many barcodes unidentified |
| Messy product names | Inconsistent, unprofessional data |
| No multi-household support | Can't share with roommates, family |
| Poor mobile experience | Desktop-first designs |
| No instance tracking | Can't track specific units (medication, electronics) |
| No cost analysis | No visibility into spending patterns |
| No document integration | Receipts disconnected from inventory |
| Limited expiration workflow | Items spoil unnoticed |

## 10.11.3 Solution

Homebot addresses these issues through:

| Feature | Benefit |
|---------|---------|
| Multi-source lookup + LLM | >95% barcode recognition with clean names |
| Vue.js/Quasar PWA | Mobile-first with offline support |
| Multi-tenant architecture | Isolated households, shared or separate |
| LPN instance tracking | Track specific units (pills remaining, serial numbers) |
| Paperless-ngx integration | Receipt OCR, purchase linking |
| QR routing system | Scan any QR to route to correct item/location |
| Food intelligence | Ingredient analysis, safety flags |
| Cost tracking | DCA averaging, spending analysis |
| Return deadline tracking | Never miss a return window |

## 10.11.4 Tech Stack

| Layer | Technology |
|-------|------------|
| **Backend** | Python 3.13+, FastAPI, SQLAlchemy 2.0 |
| **Frontend** | Vue.js 3, Quasar v2, Pinia, TypeScript |
| **Database** | PostgreSQL 17 with Row-Level Security |
| **Cache/Queue** | Redis |
| **LLM** | OpenAI-compatible API (LiteLLM) |
| **Documents** | Paperless-ngx, Gotenberg, Tika |
| **Observability** | OpenTelemetry, Prometheus, Loki, Grafana, Tempo |
| **Deployment** | Docker Compose, systemd |

## 10.11.5 API Strategy

| API Path | Purpose | Status |
|----------|---------|--------|
| `/api/v2/*` | Primary Homebot API | MVP |
| `/api/*` | Grocy compatibility layer | Post-MVP |
| `/api/v1/*` | Legacy native API (deprecated) | Deprecated |

The v2 API is designed for Homebot's data model. The compatibility layer translates requests for apps expecting the classic Grocy API.

## 10.11.8 Target Platforms

| Platform | Priority | Implementation |
|----------|----------|----------------|
| **Tablet (Kitchen)** | Primary | Quasar PWA, optimized touch UI, offline support |
| **Mobile (Scanning)** | Primary | Quasar PWA with offline queue, Capacitor for app stores (optional) |
| **Desktop (Management)** | Secondary | PWA installed, full keyboard/mouse support |
| **API-only** | Tertiary | For Home Assistant, n8n integrations |

**Design approach:** Tablet-first (768–1024px), then adapt down to mobile (320–767px) and up to desktop (1025px+). All features work across all breakpoints. PWA includes service worker for offline shell + cached reads + offline action queue. See [30.13 UI Specification](30.13-ui-specification.md) for full details.

## 10.11.9 Development Methodology

Homebot uses the **Ralph Wiggum** autonomous development methodology:

1. **State in Files** - Progress in `RALPH_TASK.md`, `.ralph/` directory
2. **Iterative Completion** - One criterion at a time, committed incrementally
3. **BrowserMCP Validation** - E2E testing via MCP browser tools
4. **Fresh Context** - Each session reads state from files

See [10.01 Standards of Development](10.01-standards-of-development.md) for full details.
